# Design Manifesto: CryptoGuide AI

## 1. Discovery Brief (First Principles)

### What is this?
CryptoGuide AI is a **searchlight in the dark forest of DeFi**. It is not just a chatbot; it is an intelligent research companion that parses infinite noise into singular, verifiable truth. It bridges the gap between raw, complex protocol code and human understanding.

### Who is it for?
The **Crypto-Curious Professional**. People like Sarah (fintech analyst) or Ashley (tech background) who are smart, capable, but currently drowning in 50 tabs of whitepapers. They value **speed, accuracy, and credibility**. They don't want "dumbed down" — they want "clarified up".

### What is the goal?
**Radical Reduction of Cognitive Load.** To take the 10-hour, headache-inducing process of protocol diligence and compress it into 30 minutes of fluid, delightful discovery. To give the user *confidence* to deploy capital.

### What is the philosophy?
**"Verifiable Clarity."** In crypto, we say "don't trust, verify." Our design must embody this. We don't hide the complexity; we structure it. We cite every claim. We treat the source documents as sacred texts that we are illuminating, not replacing.

## 2. Aesthetic Movement: "Crystalline Intelligence"

We are defining our aesthetic movement as **"Crystalline Intelligence."**

Imagine a beam of white light hitting a prism and splitting into a perfect, organized spectrum. That is what our AI does to data. The design should feel like **precision optics**: sharp edges, clear glass, refracted light, and absolute focus.

It is **NOT**:
- "Generic SaaS" (flat blue/white, boring)
- "Degen Crypto" (neon green, matrix rain, chaotic)
- "Old Finance" (beige, times new roman, dusty)

It **IS**:
- **Sharply focused** (high contrast, blur effects used only for depth)
- **Structurally sound** (rigid grids, visible borders)
- **Illuminated** (glows used to highlight active intelligence)

## 3. The Five Pillars

### I. Color Philosophy: "Refracted Dark Mode"
We default to a deep, premium dark mode — the color of deep space or a powered-down screen. Against this void, we use **light** to signify intelligence.
- **Canvas:** Deep Charcoal / Obsidian (`#0F1115`) — softer than pure black.
- **Primary:** Electric Indigo (`#6366F1`) — The color of the AI mind. Active, thinking.
- **Secondary:** Cyan / Teal (`#06B6D4`) — Represents data and verification.
- **Accents:** Sharp White (`#F8FAFC`) for text. Muted Slate (`#64748B`) for secondary info.
- **Semantic:** Emerald (`#10B981`) for "Safe/Verified", Rose (`#F43F5E`) for "Risk/Alert".

### II. Typography: "The Modern Codex"
We pair a highly legible, geometric sans-serif (for UI/Controls) with a sophisticated serif (for the AI's "Voice"). This distinguishes the *tool* from the *intelligence*.
- **Headings / UI:** **Inter** or **Geist Sans**. Technical, invisible, precise. 
- **AI Response / Body:** **Merriweather** or **Charter**. Editorial, trustworthy, academic. reading a whitepaper should feel like reading a high-end magazine.

### III. Motion: "Fluid Precision"
Animations should feel like high-end optical equipment calibrating.
- **Snappy, not bouncy.** Easing should be `cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` (Expo Out).
- **Micro-interactions:** When selecting a protocol, the UI shouldn't just switch; it should *refocus*.
- **Loading:** Not a spinning circle. A shimmering wave or a beam of light scanning.

### IV. Spatial: "Glass & Grid"
- **Borders:** Thin, translucent borders (`1px solid rgba(255,255,255,0.1)`) define the structure.
- **Glassmorphism:** Used sparingly on floating elements (sticky headers, citation cards) to show context underneath.
- **Density:** High. This is a pro tool. We don't waste pixels. But we use consistent padding to prevent clutter.

### V. Identity: "The Prism"
- **Logo Concept:** A simple geometric prism or lens focusing light.
- **Iconography:** Thin stroke (1.5px), sharp corners. Feather or Phosphor library.

## 4. Design Brief for Execution

### Key Components

1.  **The Query Input (The Lens):** The most important element. Should float, glow slightly when active. The start of the journey.
2.  **The Answer Stream (The Spectrum):** Serif typography, excellent readability. 
3.  **Citation Cards (The Source):** Distinct visual blocks. When clicked, they unfurl to show the "Raw Truth" (source text).
4.  **Protocol Selector:** A technical dropdown, feeling like switching lenses on a microscope.

### Next Steps
1.  **Peacock:** Create Wireframes/Mockups based on "Crystalline Intelligence".
2.  **Peacock:** Define Tailwind config (colors, fonts, radius).
